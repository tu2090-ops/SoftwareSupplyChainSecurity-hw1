Part 3: Scrub Old Secrets - Writeup

Commands used to scrub personal.txt from repository:

1. Install git-filter-repo:
   brew install git-filter-repo

2. Remove personal.txt from entire git history:
   git filter-repo --path personal.txt --invert-paths

3. Temporarily disable branch protection on GitHub:
   - Unchecked "Include administrators" and "Require linear history"

4. Force push the cleaned repository:
   git push origin --force --all
   git push origin --force --tags

5. Immediately re-enabled branch protection on GitHub.

Note: git-filter-repo removed the remote origin configuration, so it had to be re-added:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/tu2090-ops/SoftwareSupplyChainSecurity-hw1.git

The personal.txt file has been completely removed from all commits in the git history.
